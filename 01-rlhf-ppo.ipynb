    "# RLHF (with PPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll apply RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, [[Ouyang et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155)]) in binary preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), the following 3 steps are conducted to finetune LLM and align human preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) : Firstly, LLM is trained to follow the supervised human dialogue dataset, with regular LLM training methods by minimizing cross-entropy loss for token ouputs. (See [here](https://github.com/tsmatz/nlp-tutorials/blob/master/09_transformer.ipynb) for regular LLM training.)\n",
    "- Build a Reward Model (RM) : Using the multiple outputs of LLM, the human annotation for comparison (such as, \"which answer is preferable, or not preferable\") is collected, and we then build a reward model to score the outputs using this annotation dataset.\n",
    "- Reward Training : With this generated reward model (RM), LLM is then trained by reinforcement learning method to maximize the reward score. In the paper, Proximal Policy Optimization (shortly, PPO) algorithm is conducted for RL method. (See [here](https://github.com/tsmatz/reinforcement-learning-tutorials/blob/master/04-ppo.ipynb) for primitive outline about PPO.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use [SmolLM2-Instruct (135M)](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct) model (chat model) to train with existing human-preference dataset, [Human-Like-DPO-Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HumanLLMs/Human-Like-DPO-Dataset), instead of collecting annotations from humans by myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note : SmolLM2-Instruct is also optimized by the following 2 phase fine-tuning.<br>\n",
    "> 1. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) : The model generated by pretraining phase ([SmolLM2 (135M)](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M)) is fine-tuned to follow chat-styled conversation by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using [SmolTalk](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceTB/smoltalk) dataset.\n",
    "> 2. Preference optimization : The model is then fine-tuned to generate the preferred outputs using [UltraFeedback](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/ultrafeedback_binarized) dataset. In SmolLM2-Instruct, DPO is applied in this phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset, [Human-Like-DPO-Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HumanLLMs/Human-Like-DPO-Dataset) is annotated to mimic human natural, informal, and conversational interaction.<br>\n",
    "Each line contains a pair of texts - one \"chosen\" and another \"rejected\". The chosen text is a preferred LLM output (more natural output) for humans, while the rejected one is a non-preferable output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reduce complexity, we don't include the following training optimization in this tutorial. :\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the original [RLHF paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155), they have applied RLHF with ranked preference, but here (in this notebook) we'll apply RLHF with binary preference.\n",
    "- We don't also apply the training mixture with pretrained dataset. To mitigate performance regression, pretraining mixture is often applied in practice. (See [RLHF paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155) or [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05862) by Anthropic.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "Note : According to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05862\">the paper</a> by Anthropic, they have conducted more meticulous RLHF steps as follows. (In this notebook, I have skipped all of these steps not to make things complex.)\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Context distillation by SFT often causes so called catastrophic forgetting, compared to the training by reinforcement learning. Not to make largely updated and overfitted, they have conducted distillation, decreasing KL divergence between base model and distilled model.</li>\n",
    "    <li>A reward model (LM for reward modeling) is initialized by a special method, which is the mixed training to reduce both autoregressive LM loss on good samples and regular preference modeling (PM) loss on entire samples.</li>\n",
    "    <li>To improve performance, they has also applied other methods - such as, adding \"end-of-context\" token at the end of each sample, etc.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see the code (implementation) step-by-step with description of theoretical aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, I have used pretrained model in Hugging Face, but **I manually configure and run training with regular PyTorch training loop** (i.e., won't use any built-in class in Hugging Face) not to make the implementation black-boxed.\n",

One effective approach is to approach the situation with a sense of detachment and mindfulness. Allow yourself to breathe and slow down by letting go of any thoughts or emotions that might be contributing to your anxiety.\n",

Allow yourself to feel the stress and discomfort of the experience, releasing any physical tension or physical sensations that might raise concerns about your resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider activities that bring you joy, relaxation, or tranquility, such as taking a day trip, reading, or practicing deep breathing exercises. This can help distract your mind from the hindrance and cultivate a sense of flexibility and well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also essential to prioritize self-care, engaging in activities that promote physical and mental relaxation, and remembering why you stayed and acted when needed. This can be a great way to recharge and regain a sense of control over your situation, even if immediate relief doesn't arrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, relaxation is an ongoing process that requires patience, self-compassion, and self-awareness. By acknowledging that it's okay to feel uncomfortable or anxious, you can begin to make adjustments to ensure a more balanced and positive outlook from the start.\n",

    "In this notebook, we have seen brief outline of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).\n",
    "\n",
    "As I have mentioned above, several optimizations are skipped in this example, in order not to make things complex.<br>\n",
    "This example is for tutorial purpose, but please take care for these aspects in real-production.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In regular RLHF, for example, actual model outputs (pairs of responses) are fed into reward modeling, but we didn't use the actual LLM outputs and we have instead used the prepared dataset in RM training.\n",
    "- Finetuning LLM in one aspect might also degrade quality of other abilities, and the pretraining mixture is often applied in practical use-case, but here (in this example) we didn't apply this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especillay, in traditional RLHF, feedback by humans is mandatory and it might be labor-intensive and time-consuming.<br>\n",
    "Today, however, in order to scale the development for alignment, the reward model (RM) can often be trained on feedback generated by an off-the-shelf LLM, instead of human feedback.  (It's called RL from AI Feedback, shortly **RLAIF**.)<br>\n",
    "In more practical RLAIF, each LLM used to give feedbacks can be specialized in particular aspect of human feedback - e.g., truthfulness, helpfulness, or harmlessness.\n",
    "\n",
