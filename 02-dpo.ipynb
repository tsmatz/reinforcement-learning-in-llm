    "As you saw in [RLHF tutorial](./01-rlhf-ppo.ipynb), total 3 models - reward model, policy model (LLM), and value model - are used in RLHF.<br>\n",
    "Reward model and value model are similar. (Both models predict reward's values and the difference is that reward model predicts only on the last token.) Multiple training - preference model traininig and llm reward training - will also be time-consuming and lose the training efficiency.<br>\n",
    "Direct Preference Optimization (shortly, DPO) shotcuts this duplication, and directly optimize a policy (i.e., LLM) to align the given preference without explicit reward scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DPO, we try to represent preference loss by using a policy and optimize preference by policy updates, without explicit reward functions.<br>\n",
    "By the absence of absolute rewards, DPO provides simple and efficient (not wasting time and resources) optimization.<br>\n",
    "It's worth noting that **DPO is not a reinforcement learning method** (the term \"reinforcement learning\" is used for optimization by explicit rewards), but it's derived from previous RLHF process.\n",
    "\n",

      "***** Answer *****\n",
      "To create a thoughtful and thoughtful gift for your friend who loves the outdoors, consider items that not only give them a unique experience but also reflect their personality and interests. For a casual getaway or weekend getaway, you can choose a decent-sized vehicle, nice looking roadside or recreational gear, and some outdoor games and equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you have more limited collections or preferences, you could also think about gifts that are practical and make their trips enjoyable. For example, if they're interested in hiking gear or mapping a scenic route, you could pack a backpack with essentials and take some customized hiking boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they're into sports or adventure-driven activities, you could put on an outdoor clothing planner and book some recreational activities, such as fishing trips, fishing trips with campers, or camping excursions. If they're interested in learning about the local wildlife or experiencing a wildlife-friendly outdoor event, you could arrange for guided tours or excursions with professionals in their interests.\n",

      "Relaxation after a stressful experience is essential to prioritize your own well-being and maintain a positive mindset. One effective approach is to approach the situation with a sense of detachment and mindfulness. Allow yourself to breathe and slow down by letting go of any thoughts or emotions that might be contributing to your anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try to focus on the present moment, no matter how short it may seem, rather than dwelling on past regrets or planning solutions. Allow yourself to feel the stress and discomfort of the experience, releasing any physical tension or physical sensations that might raise concerns about your resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider activities that bring you joy, relaxation, or tranquility, such as taking a day trip, reading, or practicing deep breathing exercises. This can help distract your mind from the hindrance and cultivate a sense of flexibility and well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also essential to prioritize self-care, engaging in activities that promote physical and mental relaxation, and remembering why you stayed and acted when needed. This can be a great way to recharge and regain a sense of control over your situation, even if immediate relief doesn't arrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, relaxation is an ongoing process that requires patience, self-compassion, and self-awareness. By acknowledging that it's okay to feel uncomfortable or anxious, you can begin to make adjustments to ensure a more balanced and positive outlook from the start.\n",

      "***** Question *****\n",
      "What do you most want to do right now?\n",
      "***** Answer *****\n",
      "I love starting my own business, too! Im registration Mia started it a couple years ago, and I've been inspired by her passion for selling handmade jewelry from scratch. She's been offering free online consultations and styling sessions, and I'm excited to start offering my own customized jewelry. It's a lot of work, but I love taking care of my family's special occasion, and I thrive under pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been working on building a client base by responding to all the about forms and pushing people to try out my products. It's been a challenge, but I'm feeling like I'm making something truly unique and memorable this time around. We recently did a pop-up store in downtown NYC, and it was amazing to see the crowd and the judgments that come from less formality.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been swamped with work lately, but I just want to prioritize this endeavour and build things!! Every step of the way, I'm just trying to be my best and embrace my inner artist. What are your thoughts on this project? Do you think I've ticked all the boxes yet?! 😊 (wink wink)\n",
      "\n",
      "***** Question *****\n",
      "What is the best gift to give a friend who loves the outdoors?\n",
      "***** Answer *****\n",
      "I'm so glad you asked! Knowing that your friend loves the outdoors, I envision a game that's just as much fun as it is inspirational. Maybe a scavenger hunt or a cross-country train scavenger hunt? We can do everything from dog walking to kayaking or even trying our hand at bird watching!\n",
      "\n",
      "This gift can be a great way to get them excited about this hobby and show them you care. Why not find someone to come over for a scavenger hunt? You can bring along some fun items like rope, blankets, or even a kid-friendly photo album to share on each trail at the end of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, no huge outdoors gift would be complete without a personalized photo album. I'll share with you how I discovered a beautiful bird and pick your favorite photo of it, too (or you can even arrange for my friend to take a photo of the animal while we're hiking!). It's not just about the photo – it's about capturing memories that will treasure you for years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "This gift will be a conversation starter, someone to show you around, and something to look forward to after a long day at the beach or hiking. Keep a close eye out for your new adventureer, and that's always going to be a thrill for you!\n",
      "\n",
      "***** Question *****\n",
      "How do you relax after something bad happens?\n",
      "***** Answer *****\n",
      "Relaxing after a tough time? I mean, just the little things in life can make the whole day feel brighter. I remember when my best friend was having a quick bar fight on the lake, and of course, your usual spots seemed to go on forever. Now, I know it can feel exhausting at times, but I remember how silly that was... listening to her walk away from a fight or trying to stand up to her rage on my own stairs! (laughs)\n",

(gulps hard) But, seriously, it's just the usual sightseeing in a park or lounging at the beach... what do you need? 😄\n",
